<H3> How to search </H3> 

<P>
Some people have found this page using AltaVista or
Yahoo search for "gay mathematicians". (How do I know -
most Web servers allow you to monitor use of the <strong>links</strong>
pointing to your page, although it is customary not to
monitor <strong>who</strong> is using them, and search
engines create the links.)
I've tried it, and while this search yields my page,
I did not manage to discover anything else which would be
relevant among the tons of produced links. </P>

<P> Instead use <A HREF="http://www.hotbot.com">HotBot</A>
search engine with the same pattern, and you will get
plenty of useful links - I include some of them below.
</P>

(<b>Remark:</b> This was written long before Google, obviously, in mid-90s, when
it was relevant. I just don't want to delete this paragraph. 
This page is more of a historical interest now, as I have not
tried to maintain it for quite a while. However, I've just 
cleaned up all the links below and all the active links work again.
Also please let me know, if there are new links I should include --- <b>April 2005</b>.)
