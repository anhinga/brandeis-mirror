<body>

<P> This is more of a curiousity item now. Since I wrote this,
a lot of great things happened. In particular, I started going
to raves, and this experience made me a much more balanced,
happy, cute, healthy, creative, and self-sufficient person.
</P>

<P> Go <A HREF="looking_for.html">here</A> for my current personal ad.

<H1 align=center> Whom Am I Looking For?</H1>

<P> I have a dream. The dream is to find a partner, who would
be willing to live and make love together, and also to do something
interesting and creative together. 
I like all kinds of entertainment and I like to share them, 
but I do not mean it here. I mean sharing intellectual and
artistic pursuits of each other, teaching each other,
studying and creating together. If this sounds too
non-standard from the viewpoint of, say,
American culture... may be this means
that we, queer people, still retain some difference from
the mainstream :-)
</P>

<P>
I am pretty good in math and computer science, and also
in some branches of philosophy, especially philosophy of
science and Eastern philosophy. I can teach them, and
I can learn these and other things.
</P>

<P>
I like when people share affection and tenderness 
and try to make life more bearable for each other.
I like when people are trying hard to avoid hurting
others.
</P>

<P>
Since I am gay, it would be better if my partner is a gay or bi
man.
On the other hand, I believe that 
it is great when gay and straight people
can bend their preferences for the right person,
provided that the truth is not hidden and everybody
understands what is going on. I value my love stories
with women and straight men very much indeed. 
</P>

<P>
I am also fairly flexible in relationships.
I respect both open and closed relations and think that
people can agree on the rules and follow them.
I used to be very much on the submissive side,
but I am much more versatile now. 
</P>

<HR>

<P> For those who care, I was born in Moscow, USSR
on October 3, 1964.
I never say that I am from Russia, I came from
Soviet Union in 1989 fully believing (so stupid I was),
that Soviet Union would exist longer than me.
So I am a Soviet boy who used his chance to escape
from the Communists. I do not know or understand the
country which is there now. I definitely do not
identify with that country - I never lived there.
The country I am from is just a memory, for better
or for worse.
