<H1 align=center> Win-1251, Koi8-R to VOLAPJUK </H1>

<P>
Who might need a poor man's russificator? Someone, who has a favorite
outdated piece of equipment, which cannot be russified, like my favorite
VT100 terminal. Someone who uses public computers, usually a different
computer each time, and does not want to launch a crusade to russify
every computer in the country. Or someone, who is just too lazy to go
through the installation motions, but still wants to read a Russian text
once in a while.

<P>
Here is a C program, <A HREF="rus.c">rus.c</A>, which takes a file from 
the standard input, and creates two files, 
<STRONG>win1251.out</STRONG> and <STRONG>koi8r.out</STRONG>,
in the current directory. In these files, the symbols, which are codes
of Russian letters in, respectively, Win-1251 and Koi8-R, are replaced
with their English transliterations --- this sort of "volapjuk" is known
at least since Russians started to use international telegraph and is
familiar to many e-mail veterans in USA and elsewhere.

Please feel free to use and/or modify this program as you wish ---
I am not responsible for it in any manner.
