<P> Mathematics; Computer Science; Software Engineering.

<P> 
I am trying to combine theoretical research and practical applications.
</P>
<P> 
    My theoretical interests concentrate in <STRONG>applications of continuous
 mathematics to computing</STRONG> - 
 <EM>domains for denotational semantics</EM> give 
 the prime example of such applications.
</P>
<P>
   My practical interests are in programming language design and
 implementation, and in methods and tools for software engineering.
</P>
<P>
   If you are interested in collaboration please let me know -
 I am always looking for people to work with.
</P>
