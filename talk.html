<!-- Computing Distances Between Programs via Domains: -->
COMPUTING DISTANCES BETWEEN PROGRAMS VIA DOMAINS:
a Symmetric Continuous Generalized Metric for
Scott Topology on Continuous Scott Domains </H1>

<H3 align=center>Michael A. Bukatin - Brandeis University, Computer Science<BR>
Joshua S. Scott - Northeastern University, Mathematics</H3>

<P>We present a description of Scott topology on continuous
Scott domains via continuous generalized distances. The continuity
of these distances makes it possible to compute them in many
cases. In particular, applications of this construction to semantic
domains allow to compute meaningful distances between programs.
We will further elaborate on connections between continuity
and computability during this talk.</P>
