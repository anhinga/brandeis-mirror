<H1 align=center> Mishka's Page -- history of the main page (since late 1995)</H1>

<P>The site was created either in late 1995 or during 1996, when I was doing
research as a PhD student at Brandeis and working at Parametric (aka PTC). 
I wanted to publish my research results somewhere. I was also coming out,
and wanted to create a gay website.</P>

<P>That's
when my first decent results were obtained. Those were results on
computing distances between programs via related metrics on Scott domains,
which we obtained together with Josh Scott working at
my Newton office of PTC during July 4, 1996 holidays. That office was
closed soon after that.</P>

<P>That was also when we lost <A HREF="http://www.math.sunysb.edu/~kirillov/boy/igor&amp;anya.html">Anya Pogosyants and Igor Slobodkin</A>. I still remember how
I heard about that on December 15, 1995 (that was Friday, the same
Newton office).</P>  

<HR>

<A HREF="index_old.html">The earliest version I have in my Web directory
(Jun 2, 1997) -- I am resigning from Parametric and going to Russia for the Summer.</A>

<P>This was my first visit to Russia after emigration. I presented my first
decent paper at Logic at Yaroslavl conference (our paper with Josh Scott 
describing results from the previous Summer).
During that Summer working together with Sveta Shorina we discovered
co-continuous valuations.</P>

<P>I saw people I have not seen for many years. The country changed
drastically since 1989. This was also the Summer when I was able to explore 
Moscow gay life.</P>

<HR>

<A HREF="index_prev.html">Dec. 9, 1997 version.</A>

<P>Not much changes on this Web page. In reality, there were changes.
<A HREF="http://www.lucifer.com/~sasha/sasha.html">Sasha
Chislenko</A> took me to my first rave that Fall, and my life and
worldview changed drastically.</P>

<HR>

<A HREF="index_feb98.html">Feb. 12, 1998 version</A>

<P> After my January 1998 trip to Moscow. Magic winter
railroads in Moscow, a love story, huge psychedelic green
circles around white lights on railroad platforms,
Dmitrij Bushuev reads from his new book "Na kogo pohozh Arlekin", --
none of this is reflected on this page.</P>

<P>But there is a new section, "Essays by Mishka", and
two essays were posted there in December 1997 -- on the internal
time being a square root of the physical age, and on
evolutionary origins of homosexuality.</P>

<HR>

<A HREF="index_jul98.html">Jul 24, 1998 version</A>

<P>After my May 1998 trip to England. I presented
our joint work with Sveta, "Relaxed Metrics, Maximal Points, 
and Negative Information" at Mathematical Foundations of
Programming Semantics'14. I got a very cool tip from Mike Smyth,
which led to my and Sveta's subsequent paper "On a Smyth Conjecture"
about
relationship between lower bounds of relaxed metrics and
tolerances. I met <A HREF="http://www.dcs.warwick.ac.uk/~sgm/">Steve 
Matthews</A>, the mathematician who discovered partial metrics.
Without this meeting I would not have returned to partial metrics
in 2005, after leaving the field a few years earlier.</P>

<P>I've fallen in love with London, and with its rave
and gay scenes during that visit.</P>

<P>This is the first version of Web page which reflects my
involvement with rave community, and also the first version
which had the "Love Search" section. That was the period when
I was trying to be politically active and to contribute to
the struggle for 
<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_liberty">cognitive 
liberty</A>.</P>

<HR>

<A HREF="index_mar99.html">March 1999 - Jun 28, 1999</A>

<P>The anti-war page: protesting NATO aggression against
Yugoslavia. We actually participated in the street protests
against this war during that time. We also warned our senators
before the war, that the war would lead to the loss of
democracy in Russia (this prediction, unfortunately, turned
out to be correct).</P>

<P>On a brighter side: this is the first version which has
the "Current Futurist Thought" section, dedicated to
technological singularity, transhumanism, uploading,
implants, etc.</P>

<HR>

<A HREF="index_jun99.html">Canonical Jun, 1999 page</A>

<P>This the the canonical Jun, 1999 page (the Yugoslavia war
is over, so it is dropped from the page).</P>

<P>This version was redesigned on July 1, 2000 to create
the new top-level section "Science of Consciousness", and
to move "Psychedelic Music and Chemicals" and "Love Search"
seactions to the second level to reflect my new focus
and priorities.</P>

<P>Here I am starting to focus more and more on neuroscience,
philosophy of mind, and futurist topics. Unfortunately,
I don't have a pre-9/11 version of the page preserved.</P>

<HR><HR>

<A HREF="index_war.html">Dec. 27, 2001</A>

<P>The "War" page. From 9/11 to the fall of Taliban. This page
had a black background.</P>

<HR>

<A HREF="index_march_2009.html">March 15, 2009</A>

<P>My normal page in 2002-2010.</P>

<P>This was a slowly changing page. The "Science of Consciousness"
section was evolving, and so was the professional interests section.</P>

<P>I worked for the same employer during that period. 
It was very much a post-9/11 thing, with a lot of defense customers.</P>

<P>I focused
on neuroscience for a few years till approximately 2006
(and was monitoring it lightly after that).
Then in 2005 my colleagues invited me to do joint research 
in partial metrics with
them, and interesting results were
obtained regarding essential equivalence of partial metrics
and fuzzy equalities (the key observation was made during
July 4, 2006 holidays). The fuzzy equalities arose in the context
of sheaves and toposes, and this prompted me to stop avoiding
categories and toposes, and to pay more attention to 
mainstream math (and, later, physics). 
I was also blogging during the last few years.</P>

<P>Later I might try to write a better history of this period. 
However I cannot
illustrate it by an evolution of a single Web page.</P>

<HR><HR>

<A HREF="index_dec25_2010.html">Dec 25, 2010</A>

<P>The decade is ending, and I decided it is time to change
the appearence of the main
page. It's time to add this history you are reading, 
to remove the "War" section, to do some clean-up,
to try to make sure that what actually interests me now is 
better visible, and to update the futurist section.</P>

<HR>

<A HREF="index_dec23_2015.html">Dec 23, 2015</A>

<P>Those 5 years were a period of scientific progress for us. During this time we completely understood
the nature of correspondence between partial metrics and fuzzy equalities, and
published the results of our research in this area.</P>

<P>Then it turned out that presence of partial contradictions was tightly connected to 
vector semantics of programming languages, which led to our discovery of
<I>partial inconsistency landscape.</I>
</P>

<P>Most importantly, in 2015 we have finally obtained a model of computation
which allows us to <I>continuously deform programs</I> and, moreover,
to <I>represent large classes of programs by matrices of
real numbers.</I>
</P>

<P>I worked for the map division of Nokia during most of this period, which was an interesting and
extremely strange experience.</P>

<P>I have also added a couple of new essays to this site.</P>

<HR>

<A HREF="index_05.05.20.html">May 5, 2020</A>

<P>We were focusing on further development of the formalism for
programs as matrices. In 2016, we realized that the resulting formalism
generalizes <I>recurrent neural networks</I>, if we replace streams of
numbers with arbitrary streams admitting an operation of combining
several streams with coefficients (<I>linear streams</I>).</P>

<P>Also in 2016: the term <I>dataflow matrix machines</I> was coined.
The new space of "flexible mixed-rank tensors with tree-shaped indices"
(<I>V-values</I>) was discovered and studied. A general-purpose research-grade
open source implementation of dataflow matrix machines in Clojure was
created.</P>

<P>The flavor of neural machines we had obtained is expressive enough
to use those neural machines as a programming platform. These neural
machines have powerful, flexible, and convenient self-modification
facilities.</P>

<P>The 2017 was the year of publications. The reference paper, 
<A HREF="https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.07447">Dataflow
Matrix Machines and V-values: a Bridge between Programs and Neural Nets</A>
(December 2017), was published. Also, a <A HREF="revisiting-eprl.html">
paper on loop quantum gravity</A> was published in <em>Annales Henri Poincar√©</em>.</P>

<P>The 2017 was also the year when it became apparent that the health issues
are becoming more prominent as one ages. In 2020, I was reminded of that again 
(of course, we are also in the middle of CoViD-2019 pandemic right now,
and it remains to be seen how radically, or not radically, the world is
going to be reshaped by this event).</P>

<P>It does often take time, before new results are noticed and used by
the comminity (see, for example, the history of backpropagation, of ReLU, etc),
so starting from the year 2018 I was mostly focusing on further 
experimental and theoretical development of
dataflow matrix machines, with the goal of shortening the wait
before they are adopted and used by the wider community</P>

<P>The potential of dataflow matrix machines and V-values to lead to
breakthroughs in program synthesis and in metalearning is quite strong.</P>

In terms of this web site, our studies in 2012-2017 which led to the discovery
of partial inconsistency landscape and to the discovery of dataflow matrix
machines and V-values are presented here:
<A HREF="partial_inconsistency.html">Partial Inconsistency and 
Vector Semantics of Programming Languages</A>. Our studies since 2017 are
presented at the <A HREF="dmm_next.html">Dataflow Matrix Machines
(since 2017)</A> page.

<P>Several new essays and studies on neural networks were posted in the
<A HREF="consciousness_papers.html">writings on the science of consciousness</A>
section in 2017-2019, 
and a number of informal "github preprints" were published recently
following a variety of arxiv preprints which appeared in 2015-2017. 
I did a lot in open source
during these years (visual and audio-visual arts, design notes,
various pieces of software, etc). 
I am also happy that "Revolutionary" short sci-fi
was finally published on the internet in 2019 by its author (see
<A HREF="scifi.html">Selected Sci-Fi</A> section).</P>

<P>Since mid-2019, a lot of life changes are happening. The 18 year period
of working for geographic software industry came to an end. So, I became even
more focused on dataflow matrix machines research, and also on branding
and packaging dataflow matrix machines in order to make them more
accessible for the wider community (my
<A HREF="resume_bukatin.html">resume and publications page</A> also contains
a white paper on dataflow matrix machines and a collaborative research agenda).
I am also using the fact that I have more free time to get back to the
"science of consciousness", especially given that a lot of new interesting
texts appeared recently, including "The Order of Time" by Carlo Rovelli.</P>

<P>I used to prefer Python as the language of choice 
and PyTorch as the machine learning framework
of choice, but in 2020 I am also exploring Julia programming language
and falling in love with it and with the superflexible and lightweight 
<I>Julia Flux</I> machine learning framework.</P>

<A HREF="index_07.15.20.html">July 15, 2020</A>

<P>
At the end of May 2020, the next stage of Transformer revolution began.</P>

<P>
The field experienced a qualitative jump, with the OpenAI presentation
of code generator assistant demo during Microsoft Build 2020 event
on May 20, 2020 (see, e.g. 
<A HREF="https://twitter.com/matvelloso/status/1263193089310461952">https://twitter.com/matvelloso/status/1263193089310461952</A>)
and then with GPT-3 paper 
<A HREF="https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.14165">Language Models are Few-Shot Learners</A> on May 28, 2020
and <A HREF="https://openai.com/blog/openai-api/">OpenAI API</A> private beta
on June 11, 2020.</P>

<P>
We are in the middle of July and we have seen reports from enough people using
GPT-3 via that private beta, and we can confidently say that a new epoch
has started, the transition at least as consequential as AlexNet had been
in September-December 2012
has just happened. It's interesting that this coincides with a period of
unusually intense social, political, and economic turbulence 
(somehow, everything is coming to head all at once).
</P>

<P>Technologically speaking, we are at a point when things might start
changing at arbitrarily fast rate at any moment, 
in particular because people are
ready to hybridize all kinds of approaches with Transformers, just
like they hybridized all kinds of approaches with "deep" nets in
recent years. As J√ºrgen Schmidhuber is saying in recent years,
"we are almost there". Now this has literally become true.</P>

<A HREF="index_03.10.22.html">March 10, 2022</A>

<P>Before adding the "&#127482;&#127462; I support Ukraine &#127482;&#127462;" message in connection with Russian aggression against Ukraine.</P>

<P>This is the strangest time. The "second deep learning revolution" based
on Transformers and other attention-based models continues at full speed.<P>

<P>Language models competently generate computer code based on the linguistic
context (OpenAI Codex, GitHub Copilot, etc.). New methods of training
machine learning models and new AI application areas proliferate.
We now have models which can take one look at a novel neural architecture
and predict reasonably well what will the values of its parameteres be
after training (<A HREF="https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.13100">Parameter Prediction for Unseen Deep Architectures (Oct 2021)</A>).
 Crypto
currencies and NFTs are becoming more and more prominent. Charles
Stross' Accelerando is gradually becoming a reality.</P>

<P>All that is happening on top of a gradually diminishing global pandemic, with the origin
of the virus still being debated. And as the pandemic is gradually winding down,
various conflicts, coups, civil wars, campaigns of repression 
are erupting everywhere.</P>

<P>Finally, Russia is invading Ukraine in September 1939 style, 
while rather abruptly completing
its own long slide to the social system more and more closely 
resembling the social system of the
1939 aggressors. However, the aggressor's military is performing
quite poorly and failing in a rather spectacular fashion 
while meeting competent resistance and taking losses. Meanwhile, the world
recognizes the new acute danger and rapidly unites against
the aggressor. The nuclear dimension of the conflict is quite
worrying; there is also plenty of uncertainty, as Russia and the
West had not conducted full nuclear tests for 30 years, and
the maintainance of the weapons had been less than adequate, especially
in Russia, but also in the West.</P>
