We are delighted to welcome you in our Institute.
Please use your imagination and find yourself in our
marble lobby decorated with beautiful art :-)
Three more areas of our Institute are open to the public.

<HR>

<A HREF="icc_library.html">Library</A> -
the most important area of our Institute.
Here you will find what we believe is known and reasonably
well understood about the continuous models and continuous
nature of computations. The relevant
long-term research goals are listed.
We will also gradually accumulate
selected pointers and references to the relevant
literature here.

Historic attic - temporary closed

<P> History of the Institute and the people involved.

<HR>

Kitchen - temporary closed

<P> What is kitchen, and why one wants to keep it open
to everybody? Kitchen is the place where we try to
cook our dishes. What are we going to keep here?
All kinds of pieces of untested ideas, small problems,
unfinished solutions, etc. We will try to keep it
sanitary, but there are no guarantees - use it at your
own risk (but if you cook something tasty with these
ingredients, please acknowledge their use).
Why to keep it open? To stimulate thought, to save
things which look as they might be good and which
would perish otherwise, and because we do not care
about so called "priority issues" all that much.
