<H3>Remark on the Alive World
</H3> 

<P>One of the popular worldviews is that all things in the world
are alive and, perhaps, conscious (that is, have subjective
experience). Typically, this concept is treated as a purely
philosophical or religious one or as an extrapolation of some of our personal
experiences.</P>

<P>However, this concept is also true in a certain, pretty strict
sense. Namely, things that we perceive on conscious or
subconscious levels are represented by neural processes in 
our brains. It is quite mainstream to think that if anything
is alive and potentially capable of consciousness, it is
the neural processes in human brains. Hence the models of the world
which we create inside our brains indeed consist of alive
and potentially conscious things. Our inner worlds indeed
are made from alive things only.</P>
