<H1 align=center>Generalized Distances and Generalized Equalities</H1>

<HR>

<P> Generalized distances (partial metrics with values in quantales) and
generalized equalities (quantale-valued fuzzy equalities) coincide.
</P>

<HR>

<P> The generalized distances without the axiom <em>p(x,x)=0</em> are frequently used to
define non-Hausdorff topologies. They have various applications in semantics of
programming languages and in the theory of computations with real numbers.
</P>

<P>Quantale-valued sets (sets with quantale-valued fuzzy equalities) were introduced
by Ulrich H&ouml;hle
in order to give solid foundation to the theory of
fuzzy sets. They generalize &Omega;-sets introduced by Fourman and Scott 
(and also by Higgs) in connection
with sheaves and logic.
</P>

<P>In the following preprint we observe that the axioms for partial metrics 
with values in quantales coincide with
the axioms for quantale-valued sets for commutative quantales.
