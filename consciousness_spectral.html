<P>This page is about phase-sensitive (pulsed, spiked) neural
networks and spectral (frequency-based, oscillatory) methods
in neural computations and memory. Many people come to the
conclusion that exact timing of spikes is more important
than firing rates of neurons (see, e.g., my
<A HREF="neural_harmony.html">Neural Cells as Harmony Detectors</A>
essay). A lot of them also believe that the good stability-plasticity
properties of biological neural nets (their ability to learn new
information without forgetting the old) is due to a holographic-like
effect.</P>

<P>Here I mainly list some books and Web-based resources on the
subject. Here I only underline one key idea, which started to
emerge in recent years. While there are a lot of synchronization
mechanisms in neural networks, which cause the emergence of
self-organized
periodic synchronous firing of large groups of cells (see,
e.g., work on <A HREF="http://cbd.bu.edu/research/ndrp1.html"> Neural
Dynamics Research done in Boston University</A>), the way to
perform the computations and storage efficiently (at least in
the artificial models) is to hit those models with external
carrier wave (a particular frequency, be it 5 Hz or 40 Hz, does
not seem to matter that much), so that computational processes
correspond to modulations of this wave. </P>

<P>There is a growing belief that it is some kind of cooperative
activity of large group of neural cell that is the equivalent of
consciousness. What "cooperative" means here remains the key
topic of exploration. Synchronous periodic firing by groups
of neurons is one extremely bright example of such a cooperation, but
there is no good general theory of various forms of possible
cooperation.</P>
