<H6>Essays by Mishka --- see the end of this text</H6>

<P> ABSTRACT: We are trying to develop an argument, that
the presense of a small percentage of population members
with sharply defined homosexual behavior is related to
the informational component of procreation, and that it
is vital for the survival of the population.
</P>

<HR>
 
<P>
It is often asked nowadays, what are biological mechanisms
of homosexuality. There is quite a number of studies of this
subject, and even the polemics on the appropriateness of
such studies. A somewhat less addressed question is about
evolutionary mechanisms which are responsible for
homosexuality.
</P>

<P>
First, we start with what we believe are non-explanations.
The first conjecture, which we argue should be dismissed,
is that homosexuality is an "evolutionary error", or an
evolutionary neutral factor. Indeed, from the evolutionary
viewpoint there is an obvious penalty, associated with
homosexuality --- the homosexual individuals tend to produce
less offspring. Thus it seems highly unlikely, that a
significant percentage of population is homosexual,
unless there is an important factor outweighting this
penalty.
</P>

<P>
In fact, this consideration is what makes this topic interesting.
There is a mystery here --- producing less offspring should
be bad for natural selection --- what is so good in homosexuals,
that a certain percentage of them is maintained despite this
natural penalty?
</P>

<P>
Other conjectures, which I think should be rejected, are related
to the necessity to "channel" sexuality in certain difficult
conditions, to limit procreation in certain difficult conditions,
and to have more "uncles". I believe, that these considerations
might explain the ability of many, probably majority of people,
to exhibit homosexual behavior in certain extremal situations.
However, I do not see, how they can account for the phenomenon
of having a relatively small percentage of people (not enough to
produce meaningful quantity of "uncles") to exhibit sharply
defined homosexual orientation, almost immutable by external
circumstances.
</P>

<P>
It is time to remind, that the evolution, passing genes on, survival, etc.,
are, first of all, characteristic behaviors of populations, and
ly then, of individuals. Populations often need to maintain
a minority of individuals with non-standard behavior, in order
to perform some specific vital functions. Genes, responsible for
such non-standard, and from the viewpoint of producing individual
offspring, usually non-optimal behavior are getting passed by the
relatives of such "non-standard" individuals, and to certain extent,
by those non-standard individuals themselves. For example,
certain species of monkeys, which are mainly active during the day,
maintain a small percentage of population, which is active during the
night. While such "deviation" makes the feeding of "non-standard"
monkeys less efficient, this is compensated by their ability to raise
alarm and enhance the survival of the group. 
</P>

<P>
So what is the non-standard function, which can be significantly
enhanced by homosexual orientation, and which is vital for
the success of the population? I cannot think of any alternative
except the one I am about to suggest.
</P>

<P>
The division of labor and functions occur early in the
evolution of humans. The first, and deepest division,
was along gender lines --- occupations of male and female
individuals were drastically different. Even now this
division is quite visible, despite the efforts to achieve
equality of opportunity between genders. In any case, from the
evolutionary viewpoint, the period of several dozen years just
does not count.
</P>

<P>
To pass information along is vital for survival and progress of
human populations. We can, without exaggeration, to speak about
<STRONG>informational procreation</STRONG>, or informational
component in procreation. We can even think about information
carriers (like texts, in modern times), as special informational
<STRONG>members</STRONG> of human populations. Unfortunately,
to develop this viewpoint right here, would move us too far from
the subject of this essay.
</P>

<P>
The argument, we are trying to advance, is that homosexuality is
linked to the necessity to pass information, and to the fact that
information is gender-specific. The strong attraction between
same-sex individuals should be conductive for passing such information,
especially when the information is highly non-trivial, and difficult
and time-consuming to master. This argument should work for both
genders, but should manifest itself more in males, due to the fact
that females more often raise their offspring and can pass some
female-specific information in the process, but the transmission
of male-specific information is especially difficult.
</P>

<P>
Certain evidence supporting the idea that this is the mechanism
responsible for maintaining a sizable minority of homosexual
can be found in "primitive" and modern cultures. For example,
Greek philosophers used to directly link homosexuality and the
process of passing the knowledge from the teacher to the student ---
the rigid behavioral role they used to impose in the process,
now seem quite patriarchal and ridiculous, but the link itself should
not be dismissed. Another is the example of <strong>berdaches</strong>
or <strong>shamans</strong> or <strong>witches</strong> in some,
so called "primitive", but often quite contemporary 
and remarkable cultures. In all cases, we are dealing with
transmission and cultivation of highly specialized and often "elite"
or "secret" knowledge, and high incidence of homosexual catalysis
of such knowledge transmission and cultivation. In modern culture,
this might account for the phenomena of "gay sensibility", and of
higher than average incidence of homosexual orientation among
certain professions in arts and sciences.
</P>

<P>
Now the homosexual orientation is becoming beneficial in connection
with the issues of population control as well --- this was not
an evolutionary factor in the past, but it might well become one
in the future.

<P> I formulated this at some point during the 80-s and wrote
it down in December 1997.
