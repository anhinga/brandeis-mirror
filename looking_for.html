<P> A weird cool kid, bi on gay side, versatile, switch,
poly, anything goes from cuddling and vanilla to light or heavy BDSM,
depending on your longings.
Into <STRONG>raves</STRONG>, urban walks, math, computer languages, philosophy,
and mixing them with love, friendship, and intimacy.
Into uncompromising pursuit of happiness and creative life
on the cutting edge. "Just say NO to mainstream!"
Russian Libra, 34, 5'3", 120 lb, from Cambridge, Massachusetts.

<P> Looking for someone who would not be incompatible and is
not afraid.

<P>I have discovered the magic of <STRONG>tantric</STRONG> lovemaking 
recently. Contrary to standard misconceptions, tantra is
not really about any specific techniques, but about the quality
of energy, exchanged between people in love with each other
(tantric vibrations can be easily felt, if one is somewhat
sensitive and self-aware, and they are quite distinct), 
and about their ability to
feel as one entity, both physically and mentally.
</P>

<P>When tantric energy is present, it's completely mind-blowing,
and frankly, lovemaking without tantra
might seem a bit pale after tantric experiences...
