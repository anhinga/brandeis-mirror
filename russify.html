<H1 align=center> The way of typing and saving Russian texts I prefer </H1>

<P>
To type Russian texts I currently prefer
<a href="http://ourworld.compuserve.com/homepages/PaulGor/screen_r.htm">Russian
Virtual Keyboard</a> by Paul Gorodyansky.
</P>

<P>
To save Russian texts to a file I currently (June 2005) prefer pasting them
into
a platform-dependent editor selected 
from <a href="http://www.alanwood.net/unicode/utilities_editors.html">this list</a>. 
More specifically, I am
currently using BabelPad for Windows, or Yudit for Linux for this purpose.
</P>

<P>
The following (March 2005) is preserved for mostly historical reasons.

<H1 align=center> Russian UTF-8 <=> Translit </H1>

The original Poor Man's Russificator, <a href="russify2.html">
Win-1251, Koi8-R to VOLAPJUK </a>, is almost obsolete now, since
almost all computers can now render Cyrillic fonts one way or another,
and many text-based tools have transliteration rendering built into them.

<P>
So here comes Poor Man's Russificator, version 2, mostly for those
who don't install a Russian keyboard driver for any of a variety of
reasons and have situations
when they don't want to use a virtual Russian keyboard, such
as <a href="http://www.yandex.ru/keyboard_qwerty.html">Yandex Virtual
Keyboard</a>. 
</P>

<P>
Here are two C programs, <A HREF="cyr2lat.c">cyr2lat.c</A> and 
<A HREF="lat2cyr.c">lat2cyr.c</A>. <b>cyr2lat</b> takes UTF-8 from
the standard input and produces a certain version of Translit on
the standard output. <b>lat2cyr</b> takes this version of Translit
from the standard input and produces UTF-8 on the standard output.
</P>

<hr>

<P>The main uses are: creating a Russian or mixed Russian-English
text in Translit and converting it to UTF-8, or taking a Russian
or mixed Russian-English text in UTF-8, converting it to Translit,
editing it in Translit, and then converting it back to UTF-8.
</P>

<hr>

<P>Hence the version of Translit which I picked is less than ideal
for reading, but strives to be unambiguous and also to make sure
that applying first <b>cyr2lat</b> and then applying <b>lat2cyr</b>
to the result produces the UTF-8 file, identical to the original one.
</P>

<P>If you don't see Russian letters in the next paragraph, switch your
browser to UTF-8.</P>

<P>Among the specificity of the <b>cyr2lat</b> output:
"Y" (Ы) is represented as "W", "E hard" (Э) is represented as "Eh",
"Sch" (Щ) is represented as "S#", the hard sign is represented as "Q",
"Kh" (Х) is represented as "X", and the
soft sign is represented as \' (upper case) and ' (lower case).
Also all latin letters, quotes, and backslashes are enclosed in
backquotes, and each backquote is converted to backslash-backquote.
</P>

<P>Among the specificity of the <b>lat2cyr</b> interpretation of
Translit are: letters "Yo", "Ya", "Yu" start from "Y", starting from
"J" would yield 2 letters instead, "Ye" would yield the same result
as "E", and while "W" is recommended instead of "Y" for (Ы), the use of
"Y" in all other situations also would yield the same letter (Ы). The
instances of "H" not busy in serving "Ch", "Sh", "Zh", and "Eh" would
give the same result as "X". Backquotes <b>toggle</b> transliteration
on and off (so enclose the English text in backquotes), except that
backslash-backquote is converted into backquote and does not toggle anything.

Please feel free to use and/or modify this program as you wish ---
I am not responsible for it in any manner. However, if you notice a bug or
have a suggestion related to this program, its "documentation", or 
transliteration in general (including how to make a transliteration 
more convenient,
while preserving the good properties described above), my address is at the
end of my home page (link below).
