<H1 align=center>Neuroscience and Eastern Philosophy
</H1> 

<HR>

<P><strong>Abstract.</strong>
We show that mainstream neuroscience implies a number of
axioms of Eastern philosophy on the illusion of separateness. 
We also explore a strong
version of "All Is One" concept of Eastern philosophy
and synchronization effects.
We also talk about some of the ordinary life uses of
these observations.</P>

<HR>

<P><strong>References:</strong> There was a series of
conferences hosted by <A HREF="http://www.mindandlife.org">The
Mind & Life Institute</A> including dialogs between
Buddhism and Neuro- and Congitive Sciences with participation
of the Dalai Lama and a number of leading scientists.
I cannot discover references relevant to the text below
from the abstracts on the Web site, but the materials of these conferences
obviously need to be studied further for possible connections.</P>

<H2>1. Neuroscience and the Case of Subjective World.</H2>

<P>In my <A HREF="alive_world.html">Remark on the Alive World</A>
I explained
the following. Assume the mainstream hypothesis of neuroscience
that things that we perceive on conscious or
subconscious levels are represented by neural processes in
our brains. It is quite mainstream to think that if anything
is alive and potentially capable of consciousness, it is
the neural processes in human brains. Hence the models of the world
which we create inside our brains indeed consist entirely of alive
and potentially conscious things.</P>

<P>Here we show that the neuroscience viewpoint implies a
number of Eastern philosophy axioms on the illusion of separateness. 
First of all, this concerns the illusion of separate self
and separate "outside world". There is no group of neural
processes representing "self" and there is no separate group
of neural processes representing "outside world". Instead,
"self" is the whole system of all active neural processes,
and this system is the whole available world of perceptions,
thoughts, etc. Hence, in our internal world, "self" and this
"internal world" precisely coincide. There is, of course,
some group of neural processes responsible for the creation
of the illusion of separate self, but it is not clear,
whether this particular group is especially interesting.</P>

<P>Another illusion of separateness is the illusion of
separate non-interacting entities in the world. Of course,
since these entities are represented by neural processes
sharing the same neural substrate, they are very interdependent
and influence each other's properties. For example, the
perceived brightness of an object depends very much on
the brightness of other objects, etc.</P>

<H3>1.1. What Does This Mean?</H3>

<P>Of course, this does not imply that neuroscience or
Eastern philosophy are correct, but it is a strong argument
in their favor. It also emphasizes that Eastern philosophy
is not abstract metaphysics, but is based on the empirical
observations of the observable (i.e. subjective) world.</P>

<P>The last point is probably the most important one.
The "All Is One" concept is usually understood as the concept
obtained via mystical enlightment and which can only be
grasped via mystical enlightment or merely believed in.
Here we see that this concept was probably of empirical
nature, and also that this empirical observation of the
properties of inner world can actually be deduced from
our current mainstream theory on the nature of this inner world.</P> 

<H3>1.2. Practical Implications.</H3>

<P>Practically the feeling of unity between oneself and
the world is important, in part because it helps us to treat our
world, that is, to treat ourselves,
with gentleness and care. This feeling is usually very
elusive, as are many results of mystical enlightment or
religious beliefs. Sometimes we feel enlightened and sometimes
not, and when we do not feel enlightened, our connection to
our mystical insights weakens greatly. Even more so,
we tend to doubt (rightly), what we view as our religious
beliefs.</P>

<P>I found that the recall of the model presented here
does help to restore this feeling of unity to certain extent.</P> 

<HR>

<H2>2. Strong Version of 
"All Is One" Principle and Its Implications.</H2>

<P>What I just presented is essentially a weak version
of "All Is One" axiom --- namely that the person and
his/her subjective world are the same. We usually believe
that there are things going on, which are not immediately
present in one's consciousness. This includes subjective
experiences of other people, things happening in other
places/moments of time, behavior of atoms and elementary
particles, etc.</P>

<H3>2.1. Giant Generalized "Neural System".</H3>

<P>The strong version of "All Is One" principle states
the persons identity not just with his current subjective
world, but with the whole world, including things not
immediately present in one's consciousness. Basically,
while this principle does not state that all these things
are neural processes in one's brain, it nevertheless
assumes that all processes take place in the single substrate,
and that the relationships of the persons with them is
essentially the same as his/her relationships with his/her
unconscious.</P>

<P>Essentially, this principle views the world as
one giant <strong>generalized "neural system"</strong>.</P>

<P>We try here to look at some implications of this
strong principle. We will see that these implications
make this principle quite attractive. I should
remind that all scientific and philosophical theories
are usually considered to be models, which describe
what is really going on better or worse, and not considered
to represent some "absolute truth". The implications
presented below make the strong "All Is One" principle
a sufficiently attractive model. At the same this strong principle
does not follow from our contemporary knowledge.</P>

<H3>2.2. Synchronizations effects.</H3>

<P>Perhaps, the most important implication concerns those
mysterious "synchronization effects", when people tend to
synchronize to relatively similar psychological states,
and people and the outside world tends to synchronize to our preconceptions
of them. Under the strong "All Is One" principle this
probably happens via direct resonances. For example, if
I see something in the behavior of people or the outside
world, this "something" is probably an objective aspect of the real
thing. My perception of this aspect and this objective aspect itself
tend to intensify each other via resonance, and, bingo(!),
another person or my neighborhood or country really start
shifting its behavior to become closer to my perception.
Since these things also have the same effect on myself,
quite a strong synchronization force takes place. Same goes
for perception of our common reality.</P>

<H3>2.2.1. Strong Directed Resonances.</H3>

<P>Frequently two people or a larger group can achieve
remarkable results in changing their collective internal
state in the desired direction (or, sometimes, experience
very strong collective undesired changes). This includes
as examples collective sensitivity to bioenergy,
effects of collective hypnosis, strong shared emotional
states, strong focus on some subjects of thought and perception.
We are talking about effects with larger magnitudes than
could usually be achieved by single people. This is very difficult
to explain satisfactorily by anything but strong resonance
effects between their respective neural systems.</P>

<H3>2.3. Practical Implications.</H3>

<P>Regardless of the validity of the strong "All Is One" principle,
synchronization forces are part of our observable reality.
The strong "All Is One" principle merely allows to offer
a simple model for them and also suggests that these synchronization
forces are more powerful and all-pervasive, than some alternative models of
those synchronization forces suggest. The ability of this model
to explain not only interpersonal synchronization, but also
apparent synchronization of the immediate neighborhood with our
expectation, is remarkable. (Of course, this is not the only
possible explanation; another would be that we are sufficiently
sensitive to figure out what's really going on, and our
expectations merely reflect our ability to predict, but
not to make the external reality.)</P>

<P>This does not mean, of course, that the synchronization is
inevitable, as one can work in various ways with these
synchronization forces. This also does not mean that the
positive or conflict-free synchronization with everybody
or every aspect of the world is desirable. But the awareness
of the existence of such synchronization forces can be
an important tool helping to shape our behavior.</P>

<P>It is important to remember that
we are not free to imagine the reality at
our will. 
The reason is that 
we are not free to choose what we sincerely believe/suspect,
etc. However, we can try to feel various aspects of the
situation, and then we have some limited degree of freedom in
the decision to focus more or less on some of those aspects.</P>

<H3>2.3.1. Collective Work with Inner States.</H3>

<P>In the situations when people can have explicit consensus about
their goals, they can try to use resonance effects described
in Section 2.2.1 to achieve the desires states.</P>

<H3>2.4. Reincarnation.</H3>

<P>The topic of reincarnation is frequently represented in
Eastern philosophy. I do not have a firm opinion on the
evidences of reincarnation. However, what I would like to
do here is, presuming for the duration of this discourse
the existence of reincarnation, to speculate what it should
probably mean in the context of strong "All Is One"
principle.</P>

<P>More specifically, our speculation will point out some
possible parallels between a single human neural system
and the hypothetical generalized "neural system", which is
equal to the World under my version of strong "All Is One"
principle.</P>

<P>One parallel is between the unresolved cognitive science problem
of how to describe the difference between conscious and unconscious
neural processing and the unresolved philosophical problem
of what constitutes a person. My speculation is that the
principles which would eventually allow us to distinguish between
conscious and unconscious processing in the human neural system
will likely to be very similar to the principles which would
allow us to distinguish a person in the giant generalized
"neural system". Note that I think it quite likely for unconscious
neural processes to have their own consciousness, which is
just different from the consciousness of the human in question.</P> 

<P>In connection with this I speculate that when the problem
of distinguishing between conscious and unconscious neural
processing in the human brain is resolved, we are likely to
find parallels between reincarnation and such phenomena as
waking from a sleepless dream and recurrent resurfacing of neural
processes which seemed forever buried in our unconscious.</P>

<H3>2.5. Practical Implications.</H3>

<P>For me at this point practical implications are mainly
not so much in the area of human reincarnation, but
in the recognition of the need to harmonize our relations
with those more or less immortal entities, which exist or sleep
in our unconscious and get reincarnated once in a while.</P>

<P>Also it would be promising to become more familiar with
some of the entities in our unconscious and, perhaps, to
learn to cooperate with them in the solutions of some of
the problems we trying to address/research.</P>
