Singularity</A> developed by Vernor Vinge</H3>

<A HREF="singularity.html">Singularity Is More Radical Than We Think</A>.
My own text showing that implications of the technological
singularity are still quite underestimated.
These implications are analyzed here from the viewpoint
of physics and ethics.

Here are some sites, where people are really thinking innovatively and
realistically about the future dynamics of our civilization, artificial
intelligence, nature and future of humans.
</P>

<P>
There is no shortage of people, who <strong>say</strong> that they
are working on some of these issues. There is no shortage of
<strong>published texts</strong>. It is very difficult to identify
the small minority, who really contribute. Links here should be of some
help to locate some of them.

<P>Continuous process of uploading (versus "instant" uploading) seems to
be one of the main keys for "immortality" (meaning an unlimited continuous
process of progressive identity transformation as opposed to current
dynamics, which is limited in time and largely regressive in the later
stages of life) and in handling the singularity issues (a singularity
would not be a singularity for an identity, whose rate of progressive
transformation is sufficiently fast). One of the nice papers on the matter
is <A

Uploading as a Condition of Mind</A> by

</P>Beyond wearables: some people start experimenting with
<A HREF="http://www.cnn.com/TECH/computing/9808/28/armchip.idg">chip
implants</A> --- the first real step to continuous uploading.
And even more radical games with
<A HREF="http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/sci/tech/newsid_193000/193946.stm">chip
implants</A>.</P>

Thanks to <A

Chislenko</A> for showing me that this kind of research can be of truly 
high quality.
