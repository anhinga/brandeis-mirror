<H1>Applied Continuity in Computations Project</H1>

<H3>Outline by Michael Bukatin</H3>

<P>
ACC Project is devoted to organizing efforts directed towards
developing practically, technically, and financially viable
working technologies for software engineering, based on the current
achievements in understanding the continuous features
of software and software engineering.
</P>

<P>
Since the late sixties, a great progress have been made in the
developing and understanding continuous models of
computational objects, so that such traditionally discrete
objects as programs could be represented as continuous functions.
Since eighties, considerable progress have been made in developing
the theory of conventional structures from functional analysis,
such as measures and generalized metrics, over the topological
spaces involved, and it can be said with confidence that further
rapid progress in this direction is to follow. 
</P>


<P>
The question is, what should be done now, in order to enable the
use of traditional methods of applied mathematics, which are
so efficient in, say, physics and conventional engineering,
to become equally effective in the field of software engineering?
</P>

<P>
We claim, that the key problem is to learn to solve the <strong>inverse
problem</strong> to the well-studied and solved problem of
representing programs via continuous functions. This is the problem
of how to find reasonable approximations to given Scott continuous
functions, which would be sufficiently efficient from the practical
point of view.
</P>

<P>
It is possible to consider most of the Scott continuous functions
arising in practice as <strong>transformers of recursive
enumerations</strong>. This theoretical computability is, however,
insufficient for practical purposes. At least two classes of
approaches to the problem of finding practically efficient
approximations of this kind have emerged. One class of approaches
suggests the use of this recursively enumerable structure via
methods of inductive inference and learning, algorithmic probability,
and Kolmogorov complexity. Another class of approaches suggests
the consideration of this problem as a classical problem from the
conventional numerical mathematics, similar to the problem
of approximating a solution of a variational problem --- it might be
fruitful not to consider the underlying recursive enumerations
explicitly under this class of approaches.
</P>

<P>
We should emphasize here, that we are talking not
about theoretical questions related to computational
complexity --- like the question, whether an algorithm runs in
polynomial time in the worst case, but about practical
efficiency, where it is important for those polynomials
to have low degrees and constants for a typical input, and,
on the other hand,
even the issue of termination, never mind polynomiality,
needs not be considered important for some rare special inputs.
</P>

<P>
Often we should probably impose an even weaker requirement,
such that the efficient result be only obtainable in the situations
where an efficient solution
is also obtainable via classical means, like writing
code by hand, although with larger costs. Basically, we
should only strive for practical efficiency for such typical
inputs, for which it is principally possible to obtain an efficient
solution, the behavior for all other inputs is irrelevant.
