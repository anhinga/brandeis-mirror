# History of my Brandeis site and its GitHub mirror

My Brandeis site exists since mid-90s. 

Some of its parts are still being actively developed and updated.

Other parts have been frozen long time ago, but are historically valuable.

Since August 1, 2022 it has been necessary for me to physically visit the Brandeis campus in order
to maintain and update my Brandeis site. As of October 31, 2022, the remote access is still down. 

Therefore, I have created this "partial advanced mirror" which has a dual purpose:

  * To enable advanced edits of the active parts of the site (to be backported to the original Brandeis site during my campus visits)

  * To have an explicit publicly accessible backup of the most pages of this site

Only some of the links in the following pages work:

  * [index_history.html](index_history.html)
  * [index_11.20.22.html](index_11.20.22.html)
