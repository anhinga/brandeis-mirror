<H1>My Writings on the Science of Consciousness</H1>

<P>
The emerging Science of Consciousness is one of the most
central current developments. This page is for my own
writings on the subject. It covers two periods of writings:
1997-2002 (mostly neurophilosophy and philosophy of subjective realm) and 2017-2019 (learning in neural networks).

Since our neural representation of the world consists of
alive neural processes, all entities in this representation
should be considered alive.</P>

<P><A HREF="neuro_eastern.html">Neuroscience and Eastern Philosophy</A>.
We show that mainstream neuroscience implies a number of axioms of 
Eastern philosophy on the illusion
of separateness. We also explore a strong version of "All Is One" 
concept of Eastern philosophy and synchronization effects.</P>
