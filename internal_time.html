<H3>Internal Time Behaves As a Square Root
  of the Age of a Human
</H3> 

<H6>Essays by Mishka --- see the end of this text</H6>
 
<P>It is a well known phenomenon, that as we grow older,
life seems to get by <strong>faster</strong>. Many remember those
infinite days in their teenage years, and wonder why a month
passes so quickly now.
</P>

<P>Some people tend to explain this in terms of the density of
bright and extraordinary events happening, and it seems
to be little doubt, that the density of such events has quite a bit
of influence on both the current and retrospective perception
of the speed of physical time.
</P>

<P>However, let us consider the situation when the outside life
flows uniformly. It is natural to assume, that "value" of a
unit of physical time, <I>t</I>, for an individual, is inversely
proportional to his/her perception of internal age, <I>T</I>.
We are going to derive from this, that <I>T = C*SQRT(t)</I>,
where the choice of <I>C</I> is just a matter of the choice of units
for physical and internal time, so assuming that at an age of
1 physical year, the person has an internal age of 1 internal year,
we obtain <I>T = SQRT(t)</I>, where <I>t</I> is measured in years,
and <I>T</I> is measured in our artificial units of internal years.
</P>

<P>We would like to express the hope that this model reasonably describes
the relationships between physical and internal time in 
more realistic cases of
non-uniform life flow as well, although a more accurate
analysis of probability distributions is needed to confirm this.
</P>

<P>Our assumption, that "value" of a unit of physical time, that is,
its contribution to our internal time, is inversely proportional to
one's internal age, can be expressed via a differential equation
<I>dT/dt = D/T</I>, where <I>D</I> is some constant. Integrating
this equation, we obtain that <I>T = SQRT(2*D*t) + E</I>, where
<I>E</I> is another constant. Choosing the physical time coordinate
so that <I>t = 0</I> in the moment of birth, assuming that at the
moment of birth internal age, <I>T</I>, is also zero, and denoting
<I>C = SQRT(2*D)</I>, we obtain <I>T = C*SQRT(t)</I>, and <I>T = SQRT(t)</I>,
when <I>T</I> is measured in our internal years.
</P>

<P>Hence, our expected lifespan can be thought of, as 8-10 internal
years (64-100 years), of which initial physical years are especially
valuable, and thus should not be sacrificed for "successes in
future life". Indeed, assuming even the lifespan of 100 physical
years (and the shorter this lifespan, the more is the value of
initial physical years), we obtain, that the first year corresponds
to 10% of life, the years 2-4 for another 10%, they years 5-9 for
another 10%, yielding 30% of life by the age of 10. Years 10-16 yield
the next 10%, and years 17-25 another 10%, making a half-life at the
age of 25 for a person who expects to live a hundred years.
</P>

<P>Say again, it is quite stupid to sacrifice the quality of
really meaningful initial years of our lifes, in order to 
supposably insure
better quality of "future" or "adult" life. An hour of a 9-year
old is worth 2 hours or 36-years old, an our of a 16-year old
is worth 2 hours of 64-years old, etc. 
</P>

<HR>

<P>REMARK: It is important not to make an error of deriving
the equation <I>dT/dt = D/t</I>, and obtaining an incorrect
logarithmic answer. In some sense,
the results we obtained are
less pessimistic than one might have expected, after one
had agreed that time passes faster as we age.
</P>

<HR>

<P> I've made this derivation sometime in late 70-s  or
early 80-s (that is at the internal age of 4), and wrote
it down in December 1997 (I'll be 6 internally in the year 2000).

<P>(November 2015 update: It turns out this model had been discovered
at least as early as 1975:
