<H1 align="center">Just say NO to mainstream!</H1>

As parts of gay culture, as well as lambda-calculus based
programming, are quickly becoming parts of the mainstream,
it's time to leave them, and do something more radical and
innovative!

<HR>

<H3>LAMBDA 
  stands for liberation of gay
  people and software engineers!
</H3> 
 
<P> When I invented this slogan several years ago,
I did not have many reservations about it.
Now I have some misgivings about both parts of this slogan :-(
Yet... it sounds too cute not to use it :-)
</P>

LAMBDA</A> is a well known symbol of the gay liberation movement.
Yet, lately I started to have more problems with
mainstreaming of the gay culture than with the oppression
it suffers from. Not too long ago <em> gay</em> meant underground,
<em>gay</em> meant opposition. It was enough to have guts to belong,
especially to belong publicly,
and one suddenly became or was considered talented, original, etc.
Now <em> gay</em> is becoming mainstream, and it is not something
unquestionably positive, but involves numerous trade-off.
The best insights into this problem can be found in 
[<strong>Frank Browning.</strong>
<em> The culture of desire: paradox and perversity in gay lives today</em>]
published by either Crown or Vintage, circa 1993.

<P> When 500,000 people come to the Gay Pride Parade in
New York City it's a great experience, and everybody must
see it at least once in his life. But it does not take
any special courage to show up there nowadays.</P>

<P> Of course, gay culture is not unique in this respect.
The question, where is the threshold beyond which
assimilation is no longer beneficial and fruitful,
but is counterproductive and leads to the loss of identity,
is applicable in many situations. Jewish culture
provides an obvious example.</P>

<P>
What happened to Soviet dissident culture?
It has mainly disappeared. What happened to Soviet
dissident writers? Most of them seemed to be so much
more talented, when we were reading them 10 years ago...
The same thing can happen to us...

The second part was, of course, referring to lambda-calculus
and functional programming as the software engineering
paradigm, which is 
supposed to be superior to the conventional one.
Since then I realized that the word <em> functional</em>
in this approach is rather hype than reality.
Namely, functions which are first-order objects in
functional programming languages are not <em> mathematical
functions</em>, but <em>procedures</em>, so this approach
should in fairness be called <em>procedural</em> programming,
only the name <em>procedural</em> is already reserved for
the conventional approach. </P>

<P>I also realized,
that while the advantages
are few (e.g. that object-oriented programming is strictly
more powerful than functional programming as it is
understood today), the drawbacks are many (e.g. the loss
of control over computational complexity), and thus
lambda-calculus is neither a good foundation for programming
language design, nor a good foundation for the theory
of computation. My dissertation proposal contains details
of this (see my <A HREF="papers.html">papers</A>).
