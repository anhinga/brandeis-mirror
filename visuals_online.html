<P><A HREF="http://dogfeathers.com/java/spirals.html">Spiral 
Spin !</A> (by <a href="http://dogfeathers.com/mark/index.html">Mark Newbold</a>). This remarkable effect makes things move.
You need a Java-enabled browser. After the exposure to
the rotating spiral, you may look not only at the test
picture, but at other things like your own hand :-) 
(A couple of alternative links (<a href="http://shockraver.free.fr/spiralspin.gif">one</a>, <a href="http://buddychai.com/Opticals/spiral2.gif">two</a>), although none of them is as pretty as the one by Mark Newbold.)</P>

<P><A HREF="http://www.cheswick.com/ches/projects/me/index.html">The McCollough Effect</A>.
What is interesting about this effect is that it lasts for hours,
after you look at the colored picture for about 4 minutes.
The page also contains some tools allowing you to modify
the stimuli.</P>

static pictures which move</A>. Apparently, neurodynamics here is such
that oscillation in the neural system occur.</P>
