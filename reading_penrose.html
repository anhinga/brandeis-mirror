<H3>Reading Roger Penrose
</H3> 

<P><small><STRONG>Abstract.</STRONG>
We refute the arguments made by Roger Penrose
that computability considerations suggest the
impossibility of consciousness based on the
current digital architecture of computers and that
better theories of quantum collapse and quantum
gravity are needed to understand the consciousness.
Instead we argue that for a "materialistic" theory
of consciousness it is probably necessary to consider
material processes both inside and outside the
"border of the body" of a conscious entity (i.e. that
the actual body of a conscious entity is not restricted 
by its borders) and that it is likely that a reasonably
advanced theory of consciousness is necessary for
physically meaningful theories of quantum collapse and
quantum gravity.</small>
</P>

<P><STRONG>Introduction.</STRONG></P>

<P> Much more can be written about books 
<small>"The Emperor's New Mind:
Concerning Computers, Minds, and the Laws of Physics"</small> and
<small>"Shadows of the Mind: A Search for the Missing Science
of Consciousness"</small> by the well-known mathematician and scientist
Roger Penrose, than it is possible to fit within one essay. 
Extensive discussion of his books can be found
<A HREF="http://psyche.cs.monash.edu.au/psyche-index-v2.html#som">here</A>
(<A HREF="http://www.calculemus.org/MathUniversalis/NS/10/">alternative URL</A>).
This discussion contains a lot of the detailed critique of
Penrose's arguments and his attempts at their rebuttal.
</P>

<P> So what is the use for one more review? I think that Penrose's
books are quite brilliant, and thinking about them helps
us to achieve a much better understanding of problems of
consciousness and AI. At the same time I also think that
Penrose is quite wrong on all main counts. I'll try here
to outline only the most important errors in his thinking,
but at the same time to also extract the key insights one might derive
from this.
</P>

<P><STRONG> Penrose arguments.</STRONG></P>

<P> The first main argument of Penrose is that the combination
of Goedel's incompleteness theorem and apparent ability of
mathematicians to uncover the truth about the Platonic world
of mathematical objects means that any AI based on the current
architecture of digital computers will have essential deficiencies
compared to humans (and, in fact, would not have consciousness).
</P>

<P> The second main argument of Penrose is that the phenomenon
of quantum collapse is the only source of incomputability in
the world and the only place to hide the freedom of will.
Penrose correctly assumes that we do not have a good understanding
of quantum collapse, and that the progress in this understanding
is closely linked to the progress in the theory of quantum
gravity and unified quantum field theory which would
include gravity. His conclusion is that the progress in these
fields is a necessary prerequisite to the understanding the nature
of consciousness.
</P>

<P><STRONG> Computers and humans are not closed systems,
and their physical borders are somewhat artificial.</STRONG></P>

<P> We start with the first argument of Penrose. The bulk of
the related discussion addresses a very scholastic question:
whether a computer (or a human for that matter) held essentially
in a <em>sensory isolation</em> can develop and/or maintain intellect.
However, the real question is whether a computer in a real
environment can develop and maintain intellect and consciousness.
Penrose basically attributes the "non-computational effect"
to the quantum world, and any real computer is immersed in
such a world, and can take full advantage of the quantum
effects taking place in that world including the world's feedback
to the signals from the computer.
</P>

<P> This shows that no argument from the classical theory
of computability can be applicable to resolve the question of
the possibility of (at least) human-level consciousness based
on the current digital architecture. Digital computers essentially
supress quantum indeterminism inside their circuits, but still
can make use of such indeterminism outside those circuits
(on even inside their own wires on the smaller scale, if need be
eventually).
While it is possible that such a suppression might for some
currently mysterious reason preclude the computer from gaining
such things as subjective experience, I do not currently see
how a good argument to this effect can be put together.
</P>

<P> The moral of this story is that both computers and people
are not closed systems, and that environment is essential for
their functioning. Pushing this line of thinking further,
we might be willing to conclude that the physical borders
of a human body or a computer body are somewhat artificial.
Perhaps, it is more appropriate to consider a much larger
environment, or conceptually even the whole universe, as such a body,
in which the "borders", and what is "inside" and "outside"
them are parts of a single mechanism.
</P>

<P> This shows that a lot of misconceptions in and about materialistic
theories of consciousness comes from the implicit postulate that
the consciousness (subjective experience) is only related to
the processes within the borders of the body. In fact, it is likely that
there is no correct way to even formulate such a statement
(even in "Matrix" there is an exchange of signals between
the body and the rest of the universe).
</P>

<P><STRONG> Relationship between quantum theory and theory of
consciousness.</STRONG>
</P>

<P> I think Penrose correctly points out that on the ultimate,
philosophical level there must be a deep relationship between
quantum theory and theory of consciousness. Indeed, it seems
that the room for the "honest" freedom of will
at the "micro-level" is likely to
be found only within future developments of quantum theory
and, in particular, the theory of quantum collapse.
</P>

<P> For example, the evolutionary argument that freedom of will is a real
thing and not an "illusion" was discovered by many people
independently (it is likely that William James was the first,
and then Popper and Eccles did that independently, and so on).
The idea is that if we postulate that the complex subjective
experience is a result of evolution, it could only be so,
if it were adaptive, and it could not be adaptive, if there were
no way for the subjective experience to influence physical
reality. Hence subjective experience is not an epiphenomenon,
and freedom of will is not an illusion.
</P>

<P>
We here assume (I believe together with Penrose) the identity
theory of matter and consciousness, or, more precisely,
that matter and consciousness are indivisible parts of the
same "thing", just like electricity, magnetism, and light are
indivisible parts of the same "thing" (electromagnetism).
Then the unified theory of matter and consciousness might be
considered as an ultimate goal of science, and, in some
sense, as a generalization of the unified theory of matter,
as Penrose seems to suggest. So it is natural to assert 
close relationships between quantum theory of collapse
(and, perhaps, quantum gravity) and theory of
consciousness.
</P>

<P> I diverge from Penrose, when he states that there can be
no theory of consciouness without the good theory of quantum
gravity and quantum collapse. The somewhat unexpected
conclusion I am about to make is dual: perhaps, we were
failing so miserably to produce decent theories of quantum
gravity and quantum collapse so far, because the physically
meaningful versions of these theories might be impossible
without the inclusion of the theory of consciousness!
</P>

<P> In fact, the theory of consciousness to me is first of all
the theory of subjective realm (I am not a functionalist by
any means). It is quite likely that for a quite wide range of subjective
phenomena methods of classical physics would be sufficient for quite
excellent approximations, just as they were sufficient in the
objective realm. On the other hand, it is the more exotic and
less verified subjective experiences (many of them are certainly
quite real, because there is enough first hand experiences from
credible sources), which are likely to need quantum explanations.
</P>

<P> However, if quantum collapse is the ultimate low-level expression
of free will (and the resulting distributions are basically
the results of "census" of population of particles), then it is not
surprising that we cannot find anything better than questionable
probabilistic models without taking this free will into account.
And if quantum gravity and unified quantum field theory are
supposed to constitute "the general theory of everything", they
should <em>include</em> the theory of consciousness, because the
consciousness is part of that "everything".
</P>

<P> So my take is different from the take of Penrose.
It is not that we need quantum gravity for a decent
theory of consciousness (although we might need it at some
later stage of theory of consciosness). It is more likely
that we will need a sufficiently general theory of consciousness
to obtain a physically meaningful theory of quantum gravity.
