<H3>Relaxed Distances --- Computable Distances between Programs: </H3>

<P> Michael A. Bukatin, Joshua S. Scott. <A HREF="dist_lfcs.ps.gz">
Towards Computing Distances between Programs via Scott Domains.</A>
In S. Adian, A. Nerode, eds., Logical Foundations of
Computer Science, <I>Lecture Notes in Computer Science</I>,
<STRONG> 1234</STRONG>, 33-43, Springer, 1997. 
</P>

<P> This electronic 
version of 03/07/97
is the same as the text published in LNCS 1234 ---  
the proceedings of the <A HREF="http://www.ras.ru/lpcs/lfcs.html">
4th International
Symposium on Logical Foundations of Computer Science (LFCS'97)</A>.
</P>

<P> We show that a computable distance between two equal partially
defined objects, <I>x=y</I>, must be non-zero under very weak
assumptions, thus making <strong>partial metrics</strong> by 
<A HREF="http://www.dcs.warwick.ac.uk/pub/people/staff/Steve.Matthews/index.html">Steve Matthews</A>
and our own <strong>relaxed metrics</strong> the preferable
way to define semantically meaningful distances between
programs.
</P>

<P> My co-author
<A HREF="http://www.math.brandeis.edu/~josh">Joshua Scott</A> received
his undergraduate degree in Math from Brandeis
(Spring 1996) and now studies at Northeastern. The key results were
obtained during our joint studies on July 4, 1996 holidays.
</P>

<P> Some extra details and an inductive,
rather than deductive, angle of presentation
can be found at <A HREF="dist_new.ps.gz"> 
Towards Computing Distances between Programs via Domains</A>
(version of 12/05/96).
It has a scary subtitle:
<EM>a Symmetric Continuous Generalized Metric for
Scott Topology on Continuous Scott
Domains with Countable Bases</EM>.
The inductive presentation means that
the results are presented in the sequence
and order they were discovered, and guiding motivations
at each step are emphasized, not hidden.
The deductive presentation (as in the published version
of our paper) means that the results are arranged into
an elegant logical scheme, from the general versions
of definitions to partial cases, but the traces of how this
scheme was obtained are largely erased.
</P> 

<P> The 
<A HREF="dist.ps.gz">previous version of this paper</A>
(version 3.0 of 10/06/96) is somewhat longer, but it
does not contain the references to the related papers
by S. G. Matthews and by S. J. O'Neill and discussion of
the differences between our construction and the one by
O'Neill, as we did not know that these results are
related. <A HREF="talk.html">It was presented on 10/09/96.</A>

<H2 align=center>Logic of Fixed Points for Approximation Domains</H2>

<HR>

<P>
The following three papers study domains for denotational
semantics as sets of theories of logical calculi.
They are reviewed in my dissertation proposal.
</P>
<P>
<A HREF="Nov94.ps.gz"> Subdomains for Algebraic Information Systems</A>
solves the question "which subsets of domains should be considered
subdomains?".
</P>
<P>
<A HREF="Dec94.ps.gz">Information Systems and Retractions: an Elementary
Treatment</A> 
studies finitary retractions.
</P>

<P>
<A HREF="https://web.archive.org/web/20121206043027/at.yorku.ca/cgi-bin/amca/caae-10">
Information Systems and Complete Lattices</A> is an
abstract of my talk on the intuition behind
the use of non-reflexive logics for description of non-algebraic
domains (see my dissertation proposal for details).

<H2 align=center>Dissertation Materials</H2>


<HR>

<P> My dissertation proposal is a review of the field
and a position paper. It is fairly controversial,
because it is trying to make a case that things
are pretty bad in the programming language theory
and practice, and because it is
also trying to explain why they are so bad.
