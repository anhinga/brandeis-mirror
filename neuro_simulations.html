<P>Because it is more and more difficult to run Java applets in a browser these days,
the links in this page are not mirrored.</P>

<h3>WARNING: These experiments overrely on the Java promise
that applets should not be able to harm the client machine.
As a result, not enough attention is paid to the handling
of the events related to closing of a window or a tab. Because
Java actually breaks this promise, the client Web browser might crash
when a tab or a window running one of these applets is being closed.</h3>
