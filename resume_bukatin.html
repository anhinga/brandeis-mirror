&#127482;&#127462; I support Ukraine &#127482;&#127462;

<hr>

<p>I am focusing on <a href="dmm_next.html">dataflow matrix machines</a>, a highly expressive
flavor of programmable neural networks (see links on page 3 of this resume).</p>

<p><b>I am looking for an organization or a group of people 
which would like to take a lead in
  developing technologies based on dataflow matrix machines.</b></p>

<p><b>I am also quite open to informal research and engineering 
  collaborations on dataflow matrix machines and related topics.</b></p>

<p>I also want to collaborate on attention-based models 
including <a href="transformer_revolution.html">Transformers</a>, as this is currently the cutting edge
of machine learning and AI.</p>

<hr>

<p>There are deep connections between dataflow matrix machines and attention-based models: linear combinations of high-dimensional vector-like objects are at the center of both approaches.</p>

<p>The aim of dataflow matrix machines is to achieve convergence between programs and models, cf. <a href="https://blog.keras.io/the-future-of-deep-learning.html">The future of deep learning</a> by François Chollet.</p>

<p>Modern differentiable programming frameworks such as Zygote.jl (Julia Flux) and JAX have sufficient expressive power to handle full flexibility of dataflow matrix machines.</p>
  
<p>A <b>white paper</b> on dataflow matrix machines: <a href="dmm-white-paper-2022.pdf">dmm-white-paper-2022.pdf</a>.</p>

<p>An interdisciplinary and collaborative research agenda: <a href="dmm-collaborative-research-agenda.pdf">dmm-collaborative-research-agenda.pdf</a>.</p>

<hr>
  
<p>I am particularly interested in various possibilities to use dataflow matrix machines to enhance magic of modern Transformers.</p>

<p>I am also exploring ways and avenues to contribute to AI safety research.</p>
