<H2> Gay Mathematicians </H2>

<P><A HREF="gay_math_links.html">Internet information on 
gay mathematicians</A>.
</P>

<P>
I was always fascinated by couples sharing intellectual
or artistic pursuits. I do not think that straight couples
sharing such pursuits are more common than gay couples
doing the same, although I am not aware of any systematic
studies of this phenomenon.
</P>

<P>
Math is my primary interest, and thus I am particularly
interested in
couples doing math together.
Fortunately, we have remarkable
examples of such couples, living now or in the recent past,
in United States and in Soviet Union. I do not think that people
who are alive should be mentioned in such context on the Web, unless
they explicitly want it or unless they provide this kind
of information on their own Web pages.
</P>

<P>
However, we have a remarkable example of a couple of gay
mathematicians who lived together in the recent past in the
Soviet Union to the extent it was possible in the society
where being gay was a criminal offense, and people convicted
of it often never came back. These mathematicians
are Andrei Nikolaevich Kolmogorov, who is considered to
be the mathematician number one in this century by many
people, and Pavel Sergeevich Aleksandrov, a well known
topologist. Their mathematical achievements were recognized
by their fellow mathematicians and by the Soviet officialdom -
both were high-ranking members of the Soviet Academy of
Sciences.
</P>

<P> One day I hope to have here a home page of Kolmogorov
and Aleksandrov, something like the
<A HREF="http://www.turing.org.uk/turing/index.html">
home page of Alan Turing</A>,
another great gay mathematician, who was
somewhat less lucky than Kolmogorov and Aleksandrov.
This home page is maintained by
<A HREF="http://www.synth.co.uk/main.html">
Andrew Hodges</A>, a British gay mathematician.
Unfortunately, the people who know the most of 
the lives of Kolmogorov and Aleksandrov -
the Russian mathematicians - usually retain the homophobia
which is so strongly rooted in the Russian culture.
They never deny this
relationship, but almost always lower their voices
and look very disapprovingly, as if this is something
that should be hidden and never spoken of, while
I, in my naivete, think that this is something to
celebrate.
